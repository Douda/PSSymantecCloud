    .PARAMETER uri
    The entire URI without any query values added

    # TODO: It seems like there's a more elegant way to do this logic, but this code is stable and functional.
    foreach ($_ in $query) {
        # The query begins with a "?" character, which is appended to the $uri after determining that at least one $params was collected
        if ($_ -eq $query[0]) {
            $uri += '?' + $_
        }
        # Subsequent queries are separated by a "&" character
        else {
            $uri += '&' + $_
        }
    }
    return $uri
}
